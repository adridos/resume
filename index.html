                    <h3>The Bakery Website</h3>
                    <p>This Bakery website was created as a group project for a database systems course atOakland
                        University.
                        My group and I created a customer facing website for users to order items froma bakery for later
                        pick up.
                        This projectalso included an employee facing aspect where employees of the bakery could login
                        and see the queue of orders.
                        <br>
                        We utilized an SQL database to store all information on items available by the bakery, orders,
                        and customer information.
                        <br>
                        The README.md contains detailed information on this bakery website.

                    <h3>GrizzBlocks</h3>
                    <p>Grizz blocks,an Oakland University twist on Tetris, was a group project done Fall 2021 as a
                        projectfor my Sophomore Project course.
                        This project emhasized working as a team of developers where I was appointed the project
                        manager. We learned to use Unity inorder to create this game and used c# to write the functions
                        of the game.
                        We utilized trello as a task managment system and completed this game in the span of 3 months.
                        Details on functions and game play can be found in the GrizzBlocks Manual below
