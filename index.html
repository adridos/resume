                    <h3>The Bakery Website</h3>
                    <p>This Bakery website was created as a group project for a database systems course at Oakland
                        University.
                        My group and I created a customer facing website for users to order items from a bakery for later
                        pick up.
                        This project also included an employee facing aspect where employees of the bakery could login
                        and see the queue of orders.
                        <br>
                        We utilized an SQL database to store all information on items available by the bakery, orders,
                        and customer information.
                        <br>
                        The README.md contains detailed information on this bakery website.

                    <h3>GrizzBlocks</h3>
                    <p>Grizz blocks,an Oakland University twist on Tetris, was a group project done Fall 2021 as a
                        project for my Sophomore Project course.
                        This project emhasized working as a team of developers where I was appointed the project
                        manager. We learned to use Unity inorder to create this game and used c# to write the functions
                        of the game.
                        We utilized trello as a task managment system and completed this game in the span of 3 months.
                        Details on functions and game play can be found in the GrizzBlocks Manual below

                    <p>As a summer 2022 Product Development intern with Ford Motor company, I was assigned a project of
                        developing an internal website meant to hold information on the Digital Account team.
                        I worked closely with the UI/UX Designer who designed the website using Figma while I developed
                        the front end code of the website. The website was then hosted using Github pages.
                        The project was overseen by the Product Manager and my direct report for the summer.
                        All code was done using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
