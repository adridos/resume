              <h3>The Bakery Website</h3>
              <p>
                This bakery website emerged from a collaborative effort during a
                database systems course at Oakland University. Our team embarked
                on the creation of a user-friendly platform, enabling customers
                to effortlessly place orders for delectable bakery items
                scheduled for later pickup. Going beyond the customer interface,
                we incorporated an employee-centric section where bakery staff
                could log in and seamlessly manage the order queue.
                <br />
                The backbone of our system is an SQL database meticulously
                designed to store comprehensive information on the bakery's
                product inventory, orders in progress, and customer details. For
                an in-depth understanding of the intricacies involved, the
                README.md file provides a comprehensive guide to navigating
                through the functionalities and features of this bakery website.

              <h3>GrizzBlocks</h3>
              <p>
                Grizz blocks,an Oakland University twist on Tetris, was a group
                project done Fall 2021 as a project for my Sophomore Project
                course. This project emhasized working as a team of developers
                where I was appointed the project manager. We learned to use
                Unity inorder to create this game and used c# to write the
                functions of the game. We utilized trello as a task managment
                system and completed this game in the span of 3 months. Details
                on functions and game play can be found in the GrizzBlocks
                Manual below

              <h3>Summer 2022 Ford Motor Company Internship Project</h3>
              <p>
                As a summer 2022 Product Development intern with Ford Motor
                company, I was assigned a project of developing an internal
                website meant to hold information on the Digital Account team. I
                worked closely with the UI/UX Designer who designed the website
                using Figma while I developed the front end code of the website.
                The website was then hosted using Github pages. The project was
                overseen by the Product Manager and my direct report for the
                summer. All code was done using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

                During the Fall of 2022, I interned with The Auto Club Group's
                Innovation team, also reffered to as the Hatch Garage. I was
                assigned to design and develop an external facing website to
                showcase what the Hatch Garage team has created, the history,
                and other information about the team. This project was completed
                using HTML, CSS, and Javascript and was then hosted using AWS

                After completing the Hatch Garage website, my next project at
                The Auto Club Group was to create a website that showcased the
                internship program. This website included an FAQ and
                testimonials from previous interns.

                I continued my internship with The Auto Club group into the
                Winter 2023 semester. I worked with a team of two other interns.
                We came up with the game logic, mathematical functions and
                styling to develop a game meant to teach insurance agents about
                combined ratio.
